This programming assignment contains two files: fragment_shader.glsl and vertex_shader.glsl. fragment_shader is responsible for letting the object rotate both in the x and y directions and interpreting phone shading. An accurate method for rendering a polygon surface is to interpolate the normal vector and then apply the illumination model to each surface point. while vertex_shader is responsible for rotating the object by an angle and scaling it.
